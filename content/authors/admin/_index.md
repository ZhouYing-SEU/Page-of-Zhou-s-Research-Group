Professor Ying Zhou is the inaugural Deputy Director of the Environmental Behavior Academic Committee of the Architectural Society of China (ASC), an Executive Director of the first council of the ASC’s Healthcare Architecture Branch, and a member of both the ASC’s Aging-Friendly Architecture Academic Committee and the Computational Design Academic Committee. She also serves as the Deputy Director of the Green Hospital Architecture Professional Committee under the 11th Council of the Jiangsu Civil and Architectural Society.
She was recognized as a "New Century Excellent Talent" by China’s Ministry of Education in 2007 and received the "Craftsmanship Award for Outstanding Figure in Healthcare Architectural Design" from the China Hospital Construction Conference in 2016. Zhou is a Class 1 Registered Architect and a Certified Urban Planner in China.
She earned both her bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture from Southeast University and later obtained her Ph.D. in Architecture from the University of Tokyo. She was a JSPS Fellow at the Department of Facility Science, National Institute of Public Health of Japan. Her academic and professional work focuses on architecture in the fields of healthcare, elderly care, education, and transportation. Her recent research emphasizes the integration of environmental behavior studies, human factors engineering, and complexity science in areas such as crowd analysis, pedestrian simulation, scene analysis, and case studies.
Zhou is committed to merging research with design practice, demonstrating expertise not only in rigorous data collection and analysis but also in creating architecturally compelling and artistically expressive designs. She actively explores architectural design methodologies that enhance value.
In recent years, she has published two books and contributed to the sixth volume of the third edition of the Architectural Design Data Handbook, specifically sections on "Rehabilitation Medical Facilities" and "Mental Health Centers." Her book A Step-by-Step Guide to Drawing Architectural Construction Plans, first published in February 2013, has been widely praised and reprinted five times.
She has published over 50 academic papers in core domestic and international journals and has delivered nearly 40 keynote speeches. Zhou has led numerous architectural design projects. Notably, the Guangji Town Welfare Institute won third prize for Excellent Engineering Design in Jiangsu Province in 2010, and the Jinxi People's Hospital, a model project for township-level healthcare infrastructure in line with national development goals, received a third prize for Excellent Engineering Design in Jiangsu Province in 2016.
She has been the principal investigator for three National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) general research projects, one key project under China’s 11th Five-Year National Science and Technology Support Plan, and one research project funded by Japan’s Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.
