abstract: Agent-based models (ABM), derived from complex science, have been widely applied to solve problems in traffic, business, evacuation, and large-scale events. However, applying ABM to complex processes in healthcare environments presents new challenges, including long-term strategic goals such as route planning, scheduling, prioritization, and multidisciplinary collaboration behaviors. This study aims to propose the concept of a medical artificial society to integrate existing information technologies and better utilize new technological methods for quantitative research on complex medical building design. This study is the second phase of a two-stage research project. The preliminary work involved a 24-hour continuous surveillance video observation over a month in the ICU of a major tertiary hospital in Jiangsu Province, establishing behavior models for 34 staff members, including doctors, nurses, janitors, and caregivers. Based on this foundation, the "Agent Simulator of Healthcare Environment (ASHE)" was developed to simulate occupants' strategic decision-making and interactions. The simple behaviors of staff during their shifts and more complex event behaviors such as direct care, multidisciplinary rounds, visitor interactions, and cleaning events were modeled and simulated. The simulation results effectively replicated key area density, travel distance, and interaction frequency, providing significant insights for improving efficiency, safety, and workflow optimization. The ASHE model successfully replicates real-world conditions and underscores the importance of integrating information in healthcare environments.
